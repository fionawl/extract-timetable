# extract-timetable
some extremely ad hoc messy code to parse html from UofT's CSC course sponsor timetable page into an iCal formatted calendar
http://www.artsandscience.utoronto.ca/ofr/timetable/winter/csc.html

because maybe there's already an excel sheet of this data i have access to or possibly even exists so i can extract from instead of html anyways..
